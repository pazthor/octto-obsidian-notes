>Si tuviera que prepararme ahorita. Lo que yo haría es agarrar la estrategia que mencionan acá, cambiando los pasos 1 y 2 por la lista de blind 75, usando CTCI, EPI y otros recursos en el paso 4:
 Go to grokking the coding interview (no DONT buy it. Waste of money) and look at their list of patterns.
Pick one pattern, and go to leetcode. Search for problems with that pattern.
Go through each problem for the pattern, and go STRAIGHT to the solution. Do not even spend 1 second trying to solve the problem. WASTE OF TIME.
Understand the solution DEEPLY. Make notes. Google things you don’t understand. Watch videos on youtube about the solution. Go to the discussion section on leetcode and see what others came up with. Play around with the solution, modify variables, etc. Basically... UNDERSTAND THE SOLUTION AS DEEPLY AS YOU CAN
Move on to the next problem, and repeat.
After you have done this for enough problems, you will feel a lightbulb going off in your head. Congrats, now you know how to solve this pattern!
Go back and pick a new pattern, and do the same thing.
